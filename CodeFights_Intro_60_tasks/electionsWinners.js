Example

For votes = [2, 3, 5, 2] and k = 3, the output should be
electionsWinners(votes, k) = 2.

The first candidate got 2 votes. Even if all of the remaining 3 candidates vote for him, he will still have only 5 votes, i.e. the same number as the third candidate, so there will be no winner.
The second candidate can win if all the remaining candidates vote for him (3 + 3 = 6 > 5).
The third candidate can win even if none of the remaining candidates vote for him. For example, if each of the remaining voters cast their votes for each of his opponents, he will still be the winner (the votes array will thus be [3, 4, 5, 3]).
The last candidate can't win no matter what (for the same reason as the first candidate).
Thus, only 2 candidates can win (the second and the third), which is the answer.
